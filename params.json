The objective of The Ark project is to provide a suite of secure, integrated web-based tools that incorporate the majority of the functionality required to conduct a complex study or clinical trial.\r\n\r\nThe University of Western Australia is proud to to be in partnership with the National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources (NeCTAR) project to continue to develop The Ark application software for broad deployment to Australian and international researchers. The NeCTAR supported Cloud-based Bioinformatics Tool project was instigated with the goal of implementing additional functionality required by our collaborators and the majority of medical researchers currently undertaking data collection and analysis projects.\r\n# ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
