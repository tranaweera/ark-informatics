-- Dumping data for table `user`
--
/* note that we removed entries of the user table from the main script.  We will give a little helper script to the user to let them figure out what they need in that regard */

-- we would recommend the creation of a mysql user named root and one named 
-- arkadmin that doesn't have to have all of the root privilleges in case you have other data of importance to separate

see the relevent docs for your version of mysql (something like the following urls)
